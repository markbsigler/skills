# Assets Directory

This directory is for files that will be used in the output of upgrade workflows, not loaded into context.

## Potential Assets for Java Version Upgrade

Future additions could include:

- Template configuration files (Maven profiles, Gradle build variants)
- Common migration scripts
- Dockerfile templates for different Java versions
- CI/CD pipeline templates (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)

Currently empty - add assets as needed for specific upgrade scenarios.

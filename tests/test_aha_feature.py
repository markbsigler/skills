# Field: Description

> [!NOTE]
> **Scope:** drafts release notes from merged changes; publishing stays with people. See APP-S-1.

**As a** release manager, **I want** an agent that drafts release notes from merged changes, \
**so that** each release ships with accurate notes and I spend my time on review instead of collation.

### Agent Definition

| Element | Definition |
|---|---|
| Role | Drafts release notes for one product from merged pull requests. Can't publish its own notes. |
| Triggers | A release branch is cut (P0). A release manager asks in a session (P1). |
| Context | Merged pull requests, linked Aha! features, and the release record (PLAT-4). |
| Read actions | Pull requests, Aha! features, and the previous notes. |
| Write actions | Draft notes in the release record. Open a review request. |
| Autonomy | Drafting runs without approval. A person approves the notes before publishing. |
| Guardrails | Only merged changes. No customer names. Every note links to its change. |
| Stops and escalates when | A change has no linked feature.<br>The draft exceeds 200 entries. |
| Outputs | Draft notes, a change-to-note trace, and an escalation package when it stops. |
| Handoffs | Approved notes go to the publishing pipeline (PLAT-9). |
| Out of scope | Publishing notes. Marketing copy. Translations. |

### Workflow

1. Collect the merged changes for the release.
2. Draft one note per change.
3. Open a review request. A person approves.

### Definition of Done

- AC-1 to AC-3 pass.
- Pilot: 10 releases with at least 90% of notes accepted without edits.

# Field: Summary

Release notes are assembled by hand from merged changes. The Release Notes Agent drafts them from \
the changes themselves, links each note to its change, and leaves approval and publishing with people.

# Field: Business Problem

Release managers collate notes by hand from pull requests and features, and notes miss changes. \
Not yet measured: time spent per release and notes corrected after publishing.

# Field: Business Value

**Less effort:** at least 50% less time per release, measured against the baseline.

# Field: Use Case(s)

| ID | Use case | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| UC-1 | Draft release notes from merged changes | P0 |
| UC-2 | Route the draft for approval | P1 |

# Field: Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1. Draft from merged changes

- **Given** a release branch with merged pull requests,
- **When** the agent drafts the notes,
- **Then** each merged change has exactly one note that links to it.

### AC-2. Approval before publishing

- **Given** a draft,
- **When** a person approves it,
- **Then** the notes move to the publishing pipeline, and an unapproved draft never does.

### AC-3. Audit

- **Given** any draft,
- **When** it is audited,
- **Then** every read and write is traceable to identity and time.

# Field: Dependencies (upstream)

- Source control API: merged pull requests.
- Publishing pipeline (PLAT-9): accepts approved notes.

# Requirement: APP-12-1 Drafting

Draft one note per merged change.

- **FR-1 (P0):** WHEN a release branch is cut, the agent SHALL draft one note for each merged change.
- **FR-2 (P0):** The agent SHALL link each note to its change.
- **NFR-1 (P1):** WHEN a release has up to 200 changes, the agent SHALL finish the draft within 2 minutes.

Covers: UC-1. Verified by AC-1.

# Requirement: APP-12-2 Approval and audit

- **FR-3 (P0):** IF a draft has no approval, THEN the agent SHALL NOT send it to the publishing pipeline.
- **FR-4 (P1, ADDED):** The agent SHALL record every read and write with identity and time in the audit log.

Covers: UC-2. Verified by AC-2, AC-3.

# To-Do: Confirm the entry limit

Decide whether 200 entries is the right stop limit. (OQ-1)
